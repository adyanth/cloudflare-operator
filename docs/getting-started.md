# Getting Started

To get up and running, you need to:
1. [Install the operator](./docs/examples/operator-install)
2. [Deploy a secret with your API token](./docs/examples/operator-authentication)
3. [Create a Tunnel/ClusterTunnel resource](./docs/examples/tunnel-simple)
4. Configure routing for your tunnel by following one of:
    - [configure routing directly (simple)](./docs/examples/tunnel-binding-simple)
    - [configure routing with a reverse proxy](./docs/examples/tunnel-binding-with-reverse-proxy)

Look into the documentation in `docs/configuration` to understand various configurable parameters of this operator.
