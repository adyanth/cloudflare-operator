# Migration guidance for operator

## Migrating from pre v0.13.0
See [CRD migration guide](../crd/v1alpha2.md) for CRD migration.

## New Requirements
* [`cert-manager`](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/) >= v1.0 needs to be installed to get certificates for the webhook server.
    * Static certificates can be used, but configuring them is outside the scope of this project. Briefly, the `webhook-server-cert` needs to be created and the `MutatingWebhookConfiguration`/`ValidatingWebhookConfiguration`'s `spec.conversion.webhook.clientConfig.caBundle` (see `config/crd/patches/webhook_in_---.yaml`) need to have the correct corresponding CA bundle, along with disabling all `cert-manager` related resources.

## Changes in defaults
* The `cloudflared` image defaults to the `:latest` tag
